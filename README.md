# Project_LLM

Imagine a system where any stakeholder â€” product manager, marketer, or analyst â€” can simply ask, "Why did our model change last month?" or "What happens if we reduce ad impressions from mobile?" and get a clear, explainable answer with visual evidence.
This is not just a model; itâ€™s a living, transparent ecosystem that evolves with data and explains itself â€” intelligently.



ðŸ§­ Key Goals by Day 90:
âœ… Build an ANN prediction model using PyTorch
âœ… Support incremental training
âœ… Explain predictions (SHAP/LIME/Captum)
âœ… Compare model versions and changes
âœ… Integrate a LangChain/RAG interface with an LLM for user Q&A
âœ… Learn Python OOP & best practices
âœ… Build a modular, reusable project codebase


ðŸ•’ Weekly Time Availability
Weekdays (Monâ€“Fri): 9:00 PM â€“ 11:00 PM â†’ 2 hrs/day â†’ ~10 hrs/week

Weekends (Satâ€“Sun): Full day (assume ~6 hrs/day) â†’ 12 hrs/week

ðŸ“… Total = 22 hrs/week Ã— 13 weeks = 286 hours
