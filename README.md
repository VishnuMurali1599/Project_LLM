# Project_LLM

Imagine a system where any stakeholder â€” product manager, marketer, or analyst â€” can simply ask, "Why did our model change last month?" or "What happens if we reduce ad impressions from mobile?" and get a clear, explainable answer with visual evidence.
This is not just a model; itâ€™s a living, transparent ecosystem that evolves with data and explains itself â€” intelligently.



ðŸ§­ Key Goals by Day 90:
âœ… Build an ANN prediction model using PyTorch
âœ… Support incremental training
âœ… Explain predictions (SHAP/LIME/Captum)
âœ… Compare model versions and changes
âœ… Integrate a LangChain/RAG interface with an LLM for user Q&A
âœ… Learn Python OOP & best practices
âœ… Build a modular, reusable project codebase


ðŸ•’ Weekly Time Availability
Weekdays (Monâ€“Fri): 9:00 PM â€“ 11:00 PM â†’ 2 hrs/day â†’ ~10 hrs/week

Weekends (Satâ€“Sun): Full day (assume ~6 hrs/day) â†’ 12 hrs/week

ðŸ“… Total = 22 hrs/week Ã— 13 weeks = 286 hours

Q1
I want to create a ANN deep neural network model.
Using all parameters, function of ANN.
Where I will be giving impression as input and it will predict some output.

Now In future I will get few more impression where i will be performing incremental training on it or already having data and i will don small chages in values and will be training with already build model.

How we will get to know the working of model.?

Suppose user may ask question like --> the changes in impression on featureA which is reduced to 20 % from Jan - June , is there any affect
In model or any changes in model when trained on new data with old model

Like this more number question user can ask regarding model, attribution , explanation 

So this kind of project I planning to build through LLM so that user can ask questions through prompt regarding model,attribution , explanation or about the data can also ask

So give me ideas, flow or pipeline etc

Q2
Now i want to create this project 

create a time table for me so that i can learn concepts and create this project also 
i will use tools like Pytorch , Langchain, RAG, any LLM, and also can i can learn python OOPS coding 

Note - im a working professional i will available after 9 PM create me a time table according to that so that work and learn on the project 

Create a time table for 90 exact in saturday and sunday i will avialble entire day

After 90 days i should be ready with project and concepts also

Mon friday im ready to give 3 hours for 90 days so add more python in it



Create something like this
